I’m Mohamad Faani; I’m a husband, a father, and a software engineer. I've answered a few questions on StackOverflow.com, where I go by [Honey](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5175709/honey) username. Honey, butter and [Barbari Bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbari_bread) are proof that a benevolent deity exists who wants us to be happy. The other things that make me happy are family, rings and soccer (long time amateur soccer player and Arsenal fan). This blog is mainly a result of me wanting to add a personal touch to what I write and try something new.
