## I always get confused with request vs response. The UI makes it confusing

## There's so much traffic in Charles Proxy that I don't care about: 
- Regex
- Focus
- Ignore
- Connect physical device 
- Highlight

## Map Local to the rescue

## Map Remote vs Map Local

## Breakpoints vs Map Local

## How can I pass a request exactly as I made with all headers, URL, query params? 
- Share the session
- Get a `curl` response
- Post a gist

## What's the purpose of repeat? 
Ex you're testing the online status of your door sensors. You could either launch the app, go to the screen and test to see if it's online OR you can just repeat the network call that tells if you if it's online. 

## Is there a way for me to load test the server? 
Yeah, just use 'repeat advance' and give a certain number of network calls you like
