This is super simple. 
A: You can make network calls through some code in an app.  
B: You can also make network calls through command line tools. 

A: You can access passwords from code you wrote in your app.  
B: You can also access passwords from your command line tools. 

A is programmatic access.
B is command line access.

The API between programmatic and command line access are different.  
You may not have the same level of access.  
And obviously the a command line, doesn't have a GUI.
