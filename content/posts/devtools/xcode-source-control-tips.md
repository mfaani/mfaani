## Wishlist
- Ability to review and leave comments offline and have them sync later on 
- Select files/folder to stage/commit
- Allow double tapping on a file in code-reviewing mode to just open the file i.e. I don't want to have the need to click on the file (visual) header at the top 
- resolve conflicts similar to `file-merge` but with better UX/explanation
- ability to select which changes from a specific file can be staged/committed
- Ability to undo a specific line change from a commit.
