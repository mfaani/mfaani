## KEYNOTE

### Lock Screen
- Font & Color
- Widget Gallery
    - help get a glance...
    - I can create multiple other lock screens. So much room of personalization. 
    - Can create photo shuffle
    - Can easily swipe between lock screens.
- "Live activities": create compact and glance-able experience. Example: 
    - Uber drive
    - NBA game 
    - Music 
- Focus
    - Match a lock screen to a certain focus
    - See only **Safari Tabs** or **Inbox conversations** that are work related.
