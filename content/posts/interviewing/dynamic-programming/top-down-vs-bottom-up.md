Tabulation (bottom up - starting from top left corner)
ðŸ’¡ Tabulation should just does its work without calling others. Every subproblem is solved and finished. You just ask for values of other sub problems when you need them.
ðŸ’¡ Memoization on the other hand, will need to call others. It relies on the `return`ing value of a smaller subproblem exactly at the time of calculating its own subproblem. Every sub problem calls the recursive function and is then returned the value of its sub problem â€”Â until you hit a base case. Then a values are bubbled back up and you can return a value.
ðŸ’¡ both approaches are repetitive, but one is iterative, while the other is recursive.
ðŸ’¡ for both approaches depend on the value of other sub problems. Only that one just *retrieves* them since they were computed *in advance*, while the other *computes* them *on-demand*.


Say you needed to calculate the number of 2s in an array: 

`[1,1]` => count = 0
`[2,1]` => count = 1
`[2,1,4]` => count = 1
`[,1,4,2]` => count = 1
and so on. 

To calculate this, you could do either:

- Start count from the beginning. Increment count as you find one. Return the final count at the end
- Start counting from the end, Increment the count as you find one. Return the final count at the end. 
- Return the total count at the last index. Let it recursively ask for previous values.
