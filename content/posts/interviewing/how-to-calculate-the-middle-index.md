A good number of interview questions require you to constantly split an array/string in half.  
This is relatively easy to achieve when the array count is odd.  
However when the count is even, it's not as easy. 

```
let a = [1,3,8,10,22] // middle index is 2
```

```
let b = [1,3,8,10] // middle index is 1.5 which is non-existent. So what now?
```

Most important thing to note is: There's no such thing as "middle index" when the count is even, I mean there's two middles in that case. I guess the "middle" are those two indices.â€Œâ€Œ â€ŒBut then you have to pick one. For this reason it's often better to think of it as a **pivot** because it's really the 2nd index isn't really the middle index of a 4 element array. 

Moving away from 'find the middle index' to a 'find the pivot index which we'll use as a middle index' helped me understand the concept better.

After that, you typically just need logic that handles all three cases of before, after and the index itself. 

### Example - Flip an array

```
[0,0,2,2] -> [2,2,0,0]
```

The general way to calculate the pivot index is: 

```
let pivotIndex = (lower + upper) / 2 
let pivotIndex = lower + (upper - lower) / 2 // This approach helps avoid integer overflow. In swift we get the rounded number automatically.
```

```
[0,0,2,2]
```

pivot index = (0 + 3) / 2 = 1

```
[0,0,2,2]
   |
 pivot
```

- indexes before pivot: swap 
- indexes equal to pivot: swap 
- indexes after pivot: ignore, as they're already swapped

### Example - Binary Search

```
[2, 7, 20, 24, 40, 99]
```

find 99

pivot index = (0 + 5) / 2 = 2

```
[2, 7, 20, 24, 40, 99]
 |     |           |
left  pivot      right
```

pivot is now `index: 4`. It's now actually the middle. 

```

           |    |   |
        left pivot right
```

pivot is now `index: 5`. left and right index are also index:5

```
[2, 7, 20, 24, 40, 99]
                   | 
                  left
                  pivot
                  right
```

### Different way of seeings things

We're not always cutting the array/section in half. 

- For odd ranges: you calculate the middle index correctly. Yet youâ€™re not precisely cutting the section in half. Example: 
`[2, 7, 20, 24, 40]` will be drop three items `(20, 24,40)` if youâ€™re looking for `2` or `7`.
`[2, 7, 20, 24, 40]` will be drop three items `(2, 7, 20)` if youâ€™re looking for `24` or `40`.
`[2, 7, 20, 24, 40]` will be drop four items `(2, 7, 24, 40)` if youâ€™re looking for `20`.

- For even ranges: You're not really calculating a middle. You **may or may not** end up precisely cutting the section in half. Example: 

`[2, 7, 20, 24, 40, 99]` pivot point is `index: 2`.  

- You will drop four `(20, 24, 40, 99)` items if youâ€™re looking for `2`, `7`
- You will drop three items `(2, 7, 20)` items if youâ€™re looking for `24`, `40`, `99`
- You will drop five items `(2, 7, 24, 40, 99)` items if youâ€™re looking for `20`.

ðŸ‘† isn't to tell you think how many you're dropping. It's just once you realize you're not always cutting in half, things actually start to make more sense. Personally it helped me visualize whatâ€™s happening easierâ€¦

### Conclusion

Don't think of middle index as the absolute middle index. Think of it more as a pivot point. 
Things just work as long as you have correct logic to handle all varying cases (less than, equal to, greater than)
