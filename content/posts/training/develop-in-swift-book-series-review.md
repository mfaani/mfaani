## Develop in Swift series
- Find its Curriculum Guide from [here](https://www.apple.com/education/docs/develop-in-swift-curriculum-guide.pdf).
- Level: **high school** students (14+)
- Books contain Playgrounds & Template Xcode Projects that are used in different units. Books also contain 10-20 second videos for certain instructions. 
- Does NOT have the visual richness of the Playground tutorials. It's mainly because you're coding in Xcode, not Playgrounds.
- Does not teach using SwiftUI, Observables.
- Content: It has different books. That are meant to be read in the following order: 
    - Explorations
    - Fundamentals
    - Data Collections


In this post, I'll only illustrate the content within the _Explorations_ book. 

### Explorations
- Explorations (180hrs)
    - Unit 1: Values (Build a PhotoFrame App - Students get started with Xcode and playgrounds. They learn about the fundamental units of programming—the values that flow through their code, including text and numbers. They explore how to associate names with values using variables and constants, and how values can be used in simulations. They apply their skills to build a word game in a playground. The unit culminates in an app project to display a photo, which introduces them to the basics of Xcode and Interface Builder—tools they’ll use later for more complex projects.)

    - Episode 1: The TV Club (Students will learn how searching on the web and signing up for accounts can impact their personal information and how to think about their privacy while using apps.)
    - Unit 2: Algorithms (Build a QuestionBot - Students learn about the fundamentals of structured code. They explore how functions can encapsulate repetitive tasks and how to use if/else statements to make decisions in their code. They also learn how Swift uses types to distinguish different kinds of data. They apply their skills in playgrounds to create a dancing BoogieBot and a data visualizer. The culminating project is a QuestionBot app that responds to user input from the keyboard.)

    - Episode 2: The Viewing Party (Students learn how data is represented inside their devices and how it flows across the internet. They also learn more about security and data privacy)
    - Unit 3: Organizing Data (Build a BouncyBall App - Students explore how to create custom types using structs, group large quantities of items into arrays, and process them using loops. They also learn how to use enums to represent a set of related values. They apply their knowledge by creating pixel art, extending their data visualizer, and creating an algorithm to determine password security. In the app project at the end of the unit, they build an interactive game app with colorful shapes.)

    - Episode 3: Sharing Photos (Students explore how sharing data online can impact privacy and result in other unanticipated consequences. They also look at how images are captured and processed by a mobile device and how a social media service handles posts) 
    - Unit 4: Building Apps (Build an ElementQuiz App - Students deepen their skills in Xcode and Interface Builder in guided projects that show how to build an app from the ground up. Students use techniques to add user interface elements to a screen, connect those elements to their code, and respond to the events generated by user interaction. They also experience the incremental development of an app by gradually expanding its capabilities, testing it at each phase.)

The book is divided into four **units** that focus on building your programming skills and understanding of key concepts. Between units, you’ll explore a story about a group of students in a TV club. As you follow these **episodes**, you’ll have a chance to think about different aspects of online engagement, how information is shared online, and what kinds of decisions need to be made in a connected world.
By the end of the book, you will have built several simple apps and prototyped an app of your own design. And along the way, you’ll have gotten a taste for the world of app development—gaining an appreciation for how technology works, how you can use it to express yourself, and how it can be used to solve problems.
Each unit is divided into four sections:
- Get Started
- Play
- Build
- Design

### Fundamentals (180hrs)
- Unit 1: Getting Started with App Development 
- Unit 2: Introduction to **UIKit**
- Unit 3: Navigation and Workflows
### Data Collections (180hrs)
- Unit 1: Tables and Persistence 
- Unit 2: Working with the Web 
- Unit 3: Advanced Data Display

There's also a 4th book named: "AP CS Principles". The AP® CS Principles course extends _Develop in Swift Explorations_ to prepare students for the AP® Computer Science Principles exam.
