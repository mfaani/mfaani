 on average how long does it take you to edit a podcast episode?

2-3x the time it took to record.

you mean you spend 2-3hrs or rendering takes 2-3hrs?


stolton

For a 1 hour recording session, it’ll probably take 2-3 hours to edit.

whoa!

It depends on how many audio streams there are and how much editing you want to do to them.


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
you mean how many people speaking? (edited) 


stolton

Yeah, though you can also have other audio content in there on other tracks.


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
what do you mean by other content?


stolton

Music, sound effects, other audio clips (e.g. clip of a music event I was at).


mfaani

I mean yeah, but I thought podcasts are just about people speaking. No?


mfaani

+ just an intro music…

Some are much more elaborate narratives. Some are fiction stories. Some are news programs with high production values that includes environmental audio. It depends on how much effort you want to put in and what the type of podcast you are making.


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
Right, but for pure technical/ios podcasts, I suppose those don’t apply…


stolton

Usually, those are mostly focused on editing the conversation flow, sometimes fixing ums and ahs, etc.


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
Omg you fix those?!?


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
That's why I felt smarter about myself :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::see_no_evil:


stolton

I don’t usually try to fix a lot of ums and ahs anymore. It’s too time consuming, though I’ve experimented with some automated tools for that like Descript.

I do cut up the conversations to try to make it flow a little better and obviously remove re-takes and sometimes clip out things for a post-show segment.

I also add chapter markers and links using Logic and Forecast.


stolton

Write the show notes, too. And, I have setup Logic with some configuration for exporting the audio to be more level and EQed the way I think sounds pretty good.


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
what’s a re-take?


stolton

When someone does another take at saying something, most often with the intro or outro. Like if Kotaro fumbled a word. Or, if the connection drops for a minute and we need to get back on topic, I’ll try to cut around that and you often end up repeating yourself a bit.

ohhh


mfaani

wow this is 3x more involved than I thought


stolton

Yeah. Video is way more involved.


mfaani

I didn’t notice the chapters til now. Interesting!


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
do the chapters get added to the audio file, or it’s some other auxiliary file?


stolton

It’s in the exported wav file. I import that into Forecast, which picks them up and creates mp3 chapters and lets me add in links and chapter-specific images, if I want. Forecast converts everything into a mp3.


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
I never knew  that. Thought the audio files are just audio


mfaani
:honey_pot:  2 months ago
I suppose there will soon be some automated ways of adding chapters
