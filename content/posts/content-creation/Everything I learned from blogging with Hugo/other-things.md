# Blogging vs posting on Stackoverflow

- Scope: A blog post can be extremely broad and open ended. A Stackoverflow question is highly focused. Usually there's a code that doesn't work. Yet a blog post can be Fastline or about a simple tutorial on how to use URLSession, but then URLSession has soooo many things to demo. 
- Style: You can use your own theme with your blog. Modify the layout to your need. With Stackoverflow the layout hasn't changed for years. 
- Reach: I've had maybe around 7K visits from 2yrs of blogging. With Stackoverflow I've had **1M** visits on my posts in the same time frame.
- Social: No one can really comment on my blog posts. I try to market my posts on Twitter/Slack. Occasionally I get a like or two. With Stackoverflow I can end up getting 0-3 upvotes a day or some replies (questions, feedback, correction, edits). Each time that happens on Stackoverflow it rekindles my memory on the subject. 
- Effort: With my blog, I have to figure out the design, push to GitHub and pay for Netlify, hosting. With Stackoverflow, there isn't any ownership.
- Prestige: Stackoverflow has a certain amount of prestige. But not as much. A blog post implies more ownership. A GitHub repo that is highly liked/forked implies more. 
- SEO: It's complicated. I can't fully claim to say that my blog is indexed by Google in a timely manner (less than 3-4 weeks). Yet with Stackoverflow, your questions or answers get indexed almost by the hour. A blog post of mine may not show up for a week or it actually never ends up showing. 

## What's the difference of Hugo vs doing things on my own with HTML, CSS? See: https://g.co/bard/share/03eabb77a4f5
With both you have to come up with some base layout that all will use. Yet with Hugo you can:
- Override the base layout.
- Pass parameters down.
- Use markdown, shortcode, frontmatter, config file, special files (inde.md, _index.md) to format posts. 

## Design
Tweaking your own theme or using your theme to its extreme is a great way to improve the design of your blog. It can also be fun to learn. That said, often asking a professional web-developer to tweak and improve your blog's design, css can drastically improve the UX of your blog. Don't shy away from it. I'm looking for someone to do that for me.

 ## Final thoughts
- Because a blog post isn't focused, you can end up going very deep, or try to perfect your blog post 100 times. When you're on stackoverflow often you might need to get your answer published quicker, just for the sake of more points. With blogging I've had posts that have took me 5 months to write or posts that I wrote for 1-2 months but then never published. Yet this can also be a blessing. The freeform nature of writing things down has helped me to be better at organizing things
- I've built a better sense of ownership. I have interlinked blog post/series. Feel pround in that regard. 
- I get to learn about web development. A tiny bit of CSS and a whole lot of Hugo.
- I've written blog posts that I forgot I ever wrote them. I've came back to my blog posts a few times and re-learned things in it. It felt great!
