The first time I listened to an iOS podcast was yrs ago. I was struggling to grasp basic iOS concepts and podcasts weren't really covering basic technical material. It just didn't seem like the right way of learning about things. Two weeks ago I got invited to [Side Project Spotlight Podcast](http://phillycocoa.org/podcast/). I was thrilled but also clueless. Had to do some googling, listen to a few episodes and purchase some equipment. Here are the things I learned throughout the process.

## Talking points 
- Ask for an overview of what's going to be discussed from your host. This is what my host told me: 
!["Podcast outline"](/podcast-outline.png)
- Be prepare to introduce yourself. Practice it out. Talk about where you live. What you currently do. How you got into Programming. Where you're the most active. But also talk about your non-programming life.
- Just because the order of a previous episode of the podcast was A then B then C, it doesn't mean your talk will have the same order of sections. Your host can do whatever they want, however they feel. Everything is relaxed. Podcasts to meetings are much like meetups to conferences. 
- Stories and conversations are what's important. Have a few stories prepared. It can be about: 
    - Failures 
    - Journeys
    - Leadership
    - Friendships
    - First job or hiring experiences
    - Challenge or Success
    - Funny incidents
    - Product
    - Team
    - etc. 
    But for the most part the conversation just flows naturally. Your rehearsing just helps.
- Don't be too technical. Nor speak in length.

## How to Talk
- Speak slow and clear.
- Have a professional microphone. AirPods aren't professional microphones ðŸ« ðŸ« ðŸ« .
    - I ended buying a [Blue Yeti Nano](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti-nano/) for $69.99.
    - Kill the noise (heater, fan, kids, tv) in your room.
    - Test it. Watch a Youtube video on the microphone. Often you need to install specific hardware to be able to adjust the microphone gain (the output volume of your microphone).
    - Getting early to the recording is helpful to get feedback on your audio from the host, because they they likely have more experience than you.
    - I also learned about 'Pop Filters'. For more on that see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amWbTkjfhDk) video. I ended up not buying one and things just worked fine. 
- Here's an example of how AirPods compare with a Yeti Nano:

### AirPods2

### Blue Yeti Nano

- It's ok to have a few hiccups in your speaking. But it's good to know if you over-use something too much. I didn't realize by I somewhat overused the term "I feel like". 
- Speak with energy. Ask a friend to ask a few questions for a few minutes. Record that it. Make it a conversation, so you can gauge your energy level easier. Listen to it and see if your energy is good enough. Energy doesn't mean being loud but after hearing the recording, I often felt like I was too shy or my voice was low. 

## Other tips
- You're the guest. But that doesn't mean it's going to be all you talking. Empty your cup, your hosts have things to share as well. Everyone there is to share and learn. Truth to be told, towards the end I was asked about "what's next?" and paused. I realized I didn't have a good answer. But the insight that Kotaro and Stephen offered was really helpful. 
- Don't interrupt anyone. Nor lose your patience. Your talk will likely be on Zoom. It makes the conversation more live and easier for you to read visual cues for when someone is about to talk. And because Zoom is used, then wear nice clothes and have a decent camera background and remain attentive. 
- Don't try to correct your hosts. You actually may be incorrect. If you really needed then first check if the host is giving room for correction. Like instead of saying "That's incorrect / You're wrong". Just go with "I thought it was like .... instead. No?" and if they gave you signals that they're willing to hear more, then indulge them with more stuff. 
- If there's anything you don't want talking about then, let your host know of it days before, not just before the conversation. Be candid but also comfortable about it. 
- If something was discussed in the conversation that you didn't like or was just too off-topic, then just continue with the conversation. Often the hosts pivot a bit early in the talk, just to have enough content to select from. It's like a director doing different cuts so they can later choose the best recording. Still if there was something you really didn't want released then just ask your host to remove those sections.
- If you're seeing something on the screen, well others can't see it. Or others may be hearing about you for the first time e.g. you might need to spell out your Twitter handle or blog name letter by letter. You can't assume that people would just know how your name's spelling is.
- It's ok to go a bit over time, because there will be some editing and shrinkage. 

## Thanks

I would like to officially give thanks to all the PhillyCocoaHeads community for always supporting me with answering my questions. Facilitating meetings and inviting me to this wonderful podcast. Special shout out to [Stephen Tolton](https://twitter.com/stolton), [Kotaro Fujita](https://twitter.com/wild37) and [Aaron Bilenky](https://twitter.com/ambilenky) whom all gave me this opportunity. They changed my perception of Podcasts. I've started listening a lot more since then.
