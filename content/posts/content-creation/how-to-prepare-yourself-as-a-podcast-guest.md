The first time I listened to an iOS podcast was yrs ago. I was struggling to grasp basic iOS concepts and podcasts just didn't seem like the right way of learning about things. Two weeks ago I got invited to a [Side Project Spotlight Podcast](http://phillycocoa.org/podcast/) as a guest. I was thrilled but also clueless. Had to do some research on how to prep myself. Did some Googling, listened to a few episodes and finally did the podcast. Here are the things I learned throughout the process. 

## Talking points 
- Be prepare to introduce yourself. Practice it out. Talk about where you live. What you currently do. How you got into Programming. Where you're the most active. But also talk about your non-programming life.
- Just because the format of a previous talk was A then B then C, it doesn't mean your talk will have the same order of sections. Your host can do whatever they want, however they feel. 
- Stories and conversations are what's important. Have a few stories prepared. It can be about: 
    - Failures 
    - Journeys
    - Leadership
    - Success
    - Funny incidents
    - etc. 
    But for the most part the conversation just flows naturally. Your rehearsing just helps.
- Don't go be too technical. 

## How to Talk
- Speak clearly. That means: 
- Speak slowly. 
- Have a professional microphone. AirPods aren't professional microphones. 
    - I ended buying a [Blue Yeti Nano](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti-nano/) for $69.99.
    - Kill the noise (heater, fan, kids, tv) in your room.
    - Test it. Often you need to install specific hardware to be able to adjust the microphone gain.
    - Getting early to the recording is helpful to get feedback from the host, because they know what sound is good or bad. 
- Here's an example of how AirPods compare with a Yeti Nano: 
- It's ok to have a few hiccups in your speaking. But it's good to know if you over-use something too much. I didn't realize by I somewhat overused the term "I feel like". 

## Other tips

- Obviously. Don't interrupt anyone. Your talk will likely be on Zoom. It makes the conversation more live and easier for you to read visual cues for when someone is about to talk. And because Zoom is used, then wear nice clothes and have a decent camera background. 
- Don't try to correct your hosts. You actually may be incorrect. If you really needed then first check if the host is giving room for correction. Like instead of saying "That's incorrect / You're wrong". Just go with "I thought it was like this instead. No?" and if they gave you signals that they're willing to hear more, then indulge them with more stuff. 

- If there's anything you don't want talking about then, let the podcast host know of it days before, not just before the conversation. Be candid but also comfortable about it. 
- If something was discussed in the conversation that you didn't like or was just too off-topic, then don't interrupt the conversation. Often the hosts pivot a bit early in the talk, just to have enough content to select from. It's like a director doing different cuts so they can later choose the best recording. Still if there was something you really didn't want getting out then just ask your host to remove those sections. Very likely they'll just do it. 

- You're the guest. But that doesn't mean it's going to be all you talking. Empty your cup, your host have things to share as well. You can learn from them just as how they can learn from you. Truth to be told, towards the end I was asked about "what's next" and paused. I realized I didn't have a good answer. But the insight that [Kotaro](https://twitter.com/wild37) and [Stephen](http://stephentolton.com) offered was really helpful. 

- Speak with energy. Ask a friend to ask a few questions for a few minutes. Record that it. Make it a conversation, so you can gauge your energy level easier. Listen to it and see if your energy is good enough. Energy doesn't mean being loud but after hearing the recording, I often felt like I was too shy or my voice was low. 
- If you're seeing something on the screen, well others can't see it. Or others may be hearing about you for the first time e.g. you might need to spell out your Twitter handle or blog name letter by letter. You can't assume that people would just know how your spelling is.

- It's ok to go a bit over time, because there will be some editing and shrinkage.

Special thanks to 

whom all gave me the opportunity. They changed my perception of Podcasts. I've started listening a lot more since then.
