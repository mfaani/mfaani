Ranges in swift are super simple to create. Yet they come in various forms. 

```swift
let r1 = 1...3
let r2 = 1..<3
let r3 = ...3
let r4 = 3...
let r5 = ..<3
```

Now they all have range like characteristics, but have slightly different traits. It's because they're actually different types.

## Different Range Types
```swift
let r1 = 1...3 // ClosedRange<Int>
let r2 = 1..<3 // Range<Int>
let r3 = ...3  // PartialRangeThrough<Int>
let r4 = 3...  // PartialRangeFrom<Int>
let r5 = ..<3  // PartialRangeUpTo<Int>
```

By having different types, the compiler can enforce certain behavior within each type. Looking at the names without seeing the syntax that generates them can be confusing. Hopefully the code above helps with that. 

- `ClosedRange`: contains both lower bound and upper bound. 
- `Range`: Contains the lower bound, but not the upper bound.
- `PartialRangeThrough`: A partial interval ‚Äì up to, and including_, an upper bound.
- `PartialRangeFrom`: A partial interval extending upward _from_ a lower bound.
- `PartialRangeUpTo`: A partial half-open interval _up to, but not including_, an upper bound.

Each type exposes a slightly different set of properties. 

```swift
let r3 = ...3 // PartialRangeThrough<Int>
r3.lowerbound // doesn't compile
r3.upperbound // compiles
```

```swift
let r4 = 3... // PartialRangeFrom<Int>
r4.lowerbound // compiles
r4.upperbound // doesn't compile
```

```swift
let r5 = ..<3 // PartialRangeUpTo<Int>
r5.lowerbound // doesn't compile
r5.upperbound // compiles
```

tldr if a range doesn't really have a lowerbound / upperbound, then the syntax doesn't allow accessing it either.

## Range Usage

### Iterating over a specific range within a sequence:

```swift
let range = 1...3
let nums = [8,9,10,11,12]
for i in nums[range] {
    print(i)
}
// Output: 9,10,11
```


## Iterating over a range itself:

```swift
for i in r1 {
    print(i)
}
// Output: 1,2,3
```

## Syntax

Ranges are created using either the [`...`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/comparable/'...(_:_:)) operator or [`..<`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/comparable/'.._(_:_:)). Both have a condition that `minimum <= maximum`


Some of their capabilities are: 

- Intersection with another range
- Overlaps with another range
- Bounds (You may not have both upper and lower bounds. It just depends)
- Contains

None existing operators:

```swift
// let c = 1<.. // ERROR
// let y = 1<..11 // ERROR
```
 
## Note the importance of parenthesis: 
I got bit by this a number of times, so I thought I mention this: 
```
let points = [3,5,2]
[..<points.count - 1] // incorrect. [range - 1] has no meaning
[..<(points.count - 1)] // correct
```

```
let (x,y) = (2,10)
x...y.forEach // incorrect. 
(x...y).forEach // correct
```

## Are the following the same? 

```swift
let ClosedRange = Int.min...3
let partialRange = ...3
```

Best way is to try them out

```
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

print(numbers[closedRange]) // üí£üí£üí£ from index: -9223372036854775808 (Int.min) all the way to index: 3
```

```
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

print(numbers[partialRange]) // from the first index in the sequence, all the way to index: 3 
// Prints "[40, 50, 60, 70]"
```

`print(numbers[3...])` doesn't translate to `from index:3` to `index: Int.max`. It translates to "I want everything after this point. In this everything after (and including) 3"

Basically the start and end are implicit here. It's based on the collection they are _applied on_. Not the range of the index type.


## What do docs say in regards to ranges that don't have limits?

> It is safe to use operations that put an upper limit on the number of elements they access.

To be more accurate, the docs say (in full):

> Because a `PartialRangeFrom` sequence counts upward indefinitely, do not use one with methods that read the entire sequence before returning, such as `map(_:)`, `filter(_:)`, or `suffix(_:)`. It is safe to use operations that put an upper limit on the number of elements they access, such as `prefix(_:)` or `dropFirst(_:)`, and operations that you can guarantee will terminate, such as passing a closure you know will eventually return true to `first(where:)`.

Meaning the following have to process the **entire** before the application of `map` or `filter` is finishes. 

```swift
(1...).map { $0 * 2 } // üí£üí•
(1...).filter { $0 % 2 == 0 } // üí£üí•
```

However the following is ok, because it's immediately bounded by the array's bounds. 
```
let arr = [1,2,3][1...].map { $0 * 2 }
print(arr)

let arr2 = [1,2,3][1...].filter { $0 % 2 == 0 } 
print(arr2)
```


Conversely in the case of `dropFirst` it only has to adjust a finite number of items in the range. 

```
(1...).dropFirst(5) // good
```

Because it will never end. 

> The behavior of incrementing indefinitely is determined by the type of Bound. For example, iterating over an instance of PartialRangeFrom<Int> traps when the sequence‚Äôs next value would be above `Int.max`.

Instead do: 

```swift
(1...12).map { ... }
(1...134).filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.forEach { print($0)}

(1...).prefix(5).forEach { print($0) } // 1,2,3,4,5
```

## Where does the knowledge of ranges become useful? 
I found it to be extremely useful during [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) code challenges. I think it's also very useful for Leetcoding and Interviewing. Like instead of trying to manually skip certain bounds within an array, I just modify the range I need to access within an array. 

> Ranges help you filter the elements before you get into the for loop - Myself

```
for (i,v) in [1,2,3,4,5] {
    if i => 3 {
        return 
    }
}
```

vs
```swift
for v in [1,2,3,4,5][..<4] {
    print(v)
}
```


## Can I create ranges for stuff other than numbers? 
Yes!

> Use the closed range operator (...) to create a closed range of any type that conforms to the **Comparable** protocol. This example creates a ClosedRange<Character> from ‚Äúa‚Äù up to, and including, ‚Äúz‚Äù.

Like I've seen folks do 
```swift
let alphabets = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```
However you can simply do: 
```swift
let alphabets = "a"..."z"
```

Surprisingly I wasn't able to do: 

```swift
let r2 = "a"..."m"
print(r2.count) // Referencing property 'count' on 'ClosedRange' requires that 'String' conform to 'Strideable'
```

Shout out to [Josh Caswell](https://github.com/woolsweater) for helping me figure it out: 

The reason for this error is that there's a conditional conformance for `ClosedRange` to the `Collection`, `BidirectionalCollection`, `RandomAccessCollection` protocols. See [extension ClosedRange : Sequence where Bound : Strideable](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/core/ClosedRange.swift#L200-L201)

With Characters in Swift you don't get this conformance out of the box because Swift Characters are a _cluster_. To learn more about why Swift Characters are a cluster, see my other post on [Swift Strings for iOS interviewing
](https://mfaani.com/posts/interviewing/string/)

## Also discuss zips vs enumerated
TBD

## Is there any other range type? 
Yes. See [unboundedrange](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unboundedrange_/)
