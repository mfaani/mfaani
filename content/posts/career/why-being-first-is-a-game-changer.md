Sure, I can add onto your blog post. Here is what I came up with using the keywords and the tone, length and format you specified:

If you're ahead of others, you become people's go to person. It means more involvement. More challenge, more opportunities to grow and network. 

Being first means you can pave the way for others and be helpful. 

Means you can set the tone. Set guidelines that you want others to follow. Often you're late into some bad architecture. And folks have already made their decision on the bad architecture. Things are already in motion. The cost of correcting the mistake is too high. It's difficult to get people buy into your plan. 

Means you're informed ahead of others and have time more time to react and come up with plans. 

It shows you care. The person who's always early to meetings and makes sure the screen sharing and microphone is all working is better looking than someone who's always late and can't get their microphone working properly. 

But to show you care and informed, you need knowledge. Having automation and metrics setup in advance helps your achieve such much faster. You become the source of truth. Like just caring and being first isn't all that's necessary. You need to be first to action. First to results and deliveries. First one to fix an active incident. Or first to share findings — even if it doesn't mean a tangible result. 

And learning about your metrics is always great. 

This way you show you're the pioneer the leader.

Being first doesn't need to be about deliverables. It can also be about good culture. 
- First person to give weekly shout outs to team members.
- First person to setup a monthly lunch gathering. 
- First person to show picture of your vacation. 

Slowly others will follow your cultural impact. You'd see people giving each other shout outs. Other teams trying to mimic your team's togetherness.

But what are the benefits of being first? Why should you strive to be ahead of others in your field or industry? Here are some reasons based on research and examples:

- Being first typically enables a company to establish **strong brand recognition** and **customer loyalty** before competitors enter the arena . For example, **Netflix** was the first company to offer online movie rental service, which gave it a huge advantage over traditional video stores like Blockbuster.
- Being first also gives you additional time to **perfect your product or service** and **set the market price** for the new item . For example, **Apple** was the first company to introduce a personal computer with a graphical user interface, which allowed it to dominate the market for years.
- Being first can also influence how people make choices, as they tend to prefer the options that come first: first in line, first college to offer acceptance, first salad on the menu – first is considered best. This is because people have a cognitive bias called the **primacy effect**, which means they remember and value the first information they encounter more than the later ones.
- Being first can also boost your **leadership skills** and **personality traits**, especially if you are a first-born child . The researchers found that first borns have an advantage when it comes to **emotional stability**, **persistence**, being **outgoing** and **social**, an ability to **take initiative** and a willingness to **take on responsibility**, leading them towards top managerial positions .

As you can see, being first has many benefits that can help you succeed in your personal and professional life. So don't be afraid to take risks, innovate, and lead by example. You never know what opportunities might open up for you if you are the first one to do something.

## Is there a time that being first isn't good? 

Yes/No. Imaging figuring out how to do a repetitive task for the first time in your team. If you're first to it then you'd learn a lot about the internals. But if you're not first well then guess what. You can just go and see your team member's Pull Request, comment on it. And figure how they did it without spending the overhead of figuring something from the ground. 

You have to find the right balance of being first and when to just conform and follow.
