If you're ahead of others, you become people's go to person. It means more involvement. More challenge, more opportunities to grow and network. 

Being first means you can pave the way for others and be helpful. 

## Advantages of being first

You can set the tone, guidelines that you want _others_ to follow. And not you following others. Often you're late into some bad architecture. Folks have already made their decision on the bad architecture. Things are already in motion. Product has already signed off to the design and it's now a quarterly goal. The cost of correcting the mistake is too high. It's difficult to get people buy into your plan. 

Being first means you're informed ahead of others and have time more time to react and come up with plans. You're also the first contact point and often that means you're the contact point with another team which helps build relationships. 

It shows you care. The person who's always early to meetings and makes sure the screen sharing and microphone is all working is better looking than someone who's always late and can't get their microphone working properly or has forgot to give share access. I recall once I needed to play a video with some intro music and because I rehearsed my presentation with someone, they told me they're hearing nothing. It was because Teams was noise suppressing.

## How to be first

To show you care and informed, you need knowledge and your ears open. You need some freedom with your schedule. Having automation and metrics setup in advance helps your achieve such much faster. You become the source of truth. Like just caring and being first isn't all that's necessary. You need to be first to action. First to results and deliveries. First one to fix an active incident. Or first to share findings — even if it doesn't mean a tangible result. Did I also say learning about your metrics is always great? This way you show you're the pioneer, the leader.

Don't go solo first. Try to get a few people onboard with your iniative. Get feedback. Try to make your group/team/company first — even if it doesn't mean leading. As long as your part of the pack then that's still a major win.

## Being first for non-deliverables

Being first doesn't need to be about deliverables. It can also be about good culture. Like you can also be first to:
- Give weekly shout outs to team members.
- Setup a monthly lunch gathering. 
- Greet birthdays of team members or give a hug to a colleague whose recently loss someone. 
- Share what you learned today with others. 
- Talk about great weather. How well a meeting went.

Slowly others will follow the new cultural norms you set. You'd see people giving each other shout outs. Other teams trying to mimic your team's togetherness.

## Why should you strive to be ahead of others in your field or industry? 

Here are some reasons based on research and examples:

- Being first typically enables a company to establish strong brand recognition and customer loyalty before competitors enter the arena . For example, Netflix was the first company to offer online movie rental service, which gave it a huge advantage over traditional video stores like Blockbuster.
- Being first also gives you additional time to perfect your product or service and set the market price for the new item . For example, Apple was the [first company to introduce](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1983/) a personal computer with a graphical user interface, which allowed it to dominate the market for years.
- Being first can also influence how people make choices, as they tend to prefer the options that come first: first in line, first college to offer acceptance, first salad on the menu – first is considered best. This is because people have a cognitive bias called the primacy effect, which means they remember and value the first information they encounter more than the later ones.
- Being first can also boost your leadership skills and personality traits, especially if you are a first-born child . [Researchers from Duetsche Post Foundation](https://docs.iza.org/dp10560.pdf) found that first borns have an advantage when it comes to emotional stability, persistence, being outgoing and social, an ability to take initiative and a willingness to take on responsibility, leading them towards top managerial positions .

As you can see, being first has many benefits that can help you succeed in your personal and professional life. So don't be afraid to take risks, innovate, and lead by example. You never know what opportunities might open up for you if you are the first one to do something.
