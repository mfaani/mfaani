This post is from my personal experience with some oversimplification. 

## Software Engineering vs AI vs Medicine?

- AI is hot
- Medicine is hot. Only that it requires significant money and time investment. On average you have a debt of 200k + 7yrs of time with little money making. That's like being behind by 900k, but then once you get into the industry, you'd be making 150k-300k a year on average

Unlike Medicine, AI doesn't require a lot of money to spend, yet it requires a bit more brains like complex mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics) and a deeper understanding of algorithms, data structures, and machine learning models vs your typical programming. 

tldr Medicine pays great in the long run. AI is hot for now, but requires more effort, but perhaps they're hiring more than your typical software engineer / programmer. It's likely that it will remain the same for the foreseeable future. 

## Do I need a four year degree? 

What most people don't realize is the difference of what you're taught at university vs how much of it is useful for you at your actual job. 

> In university you're only taught a whole lot of breadth without limited depth. At work you actually need depth.

In order to become an iOS engineer you don't need to learn about: 
- Android
- Web Development
- Database
- Data Science
- Networking
- Security
- Operating Systems
- AI
- Data Structure and Algorithms
- Mathematics
- Compilers
- Computer Graphics
- Hardware, CPU, etc. 

However in a four year course they teach you lots of stuff, because they rather be safe than sorry. 
They rather have you absorb 100X more than what you actually need so it increases your chances of landing a job, plus they've got you spending at the university for four years rather than one or two. 

For anyone who already has a degree in something, it's recommended that you just focus on the domain that you want and learn that.

For example in order to become an iOS developer you have to learn: 
- Swift (and general programming concepts)
- SwiftUI (how to create views)
- Networking
- Working with the Developer Tools (Xcode)
- Some more intricate subjects of Swift Programming.

Unless you're joining a startup where you need to be a jack of all trades, you don't need to learn much about the rest that is taught in a four year Computer Science Program. 

## How do I pick the domain I like? 

### Ask ChatGPT to ask you the following question: 

> Can You ask me 10 questions and then help me figure out which field (iOS, web, Android, Security, Networking, web, DB, AI, Compilers, data structures and algorithms, framework development, etc)  of Computer science is best for me? 

It will help you get a good start.

### Can you find a mentor for the domain you like? 

Having a good mentor is critical, especially in the early stages. If you were undecided between which domain to pick, then try picking one that you can find mentors easier. There's lots of things that you're either utterly clueless about or just don't know that you don't know. Only way to resolve them is **if you have a mentor or a support group.**

## But strangers don't answer my questions online
They do. They do that a LOT!

- Answering questions of a newbie is easy. Takes almost no effort. 
- Some people actually really love and enjoy helping others. 

All you have to do is write a well crafted question. Get it to the right audience and wait for folks to come out and share their experience and wisdom.
 It's both refreshing and easy for a seasoned engineer to share answers.

## How can I find such strangers to answer my questions? 

- [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com)
- [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) and their associated Slack Groups. 

The last one is key. People tend to care more when its someone from their own town, neighborhood. 
Most Meetup group these days have their own Slack group where you could remain in contact through out the week / month. 
I learned a lot from my local Slack group. It was named [PhillyCocoahHeads](http://phillycocoa.org).

Stackoverflow.com's main benefit is that it's open to public and conversations are forever available. Though the UI of the site and its culture need some love. 
Slack may have a time limit for how long it keeps the history of conversations (typically 180 days) and is only available to the members of the Slack organization. 
Yet it's in real time and often with people that you actually know. 

Medium.com is public but it is not meant to be a Q&A place or where discussions happen. It's more of a fancy micro blog platform. 
ChatGPT (and don't forget claude.ai) is getting better and better at answering, but often there's some tribal knowledge or lack of a human element that makes understanding directly from ChatGPT difficult. 

Nowadays if I need something I search for it or ask ChatGPT. 
If I can't figure things out or create my own working code then depending on the factors listed below, I decide to take it to to either Stackoverflow or Slack
- The type of question.
- How experienced and responsive the Slack vs Stackoverflow folks are on that subject.
- When was the last time I asked a question. I don't want to be asking too many questions from the same people. 

Example:
- On Stackoverflow, due to its requirements for having straightforward answers, you can not ask an _open ended_ question of: "Will I make more money by being an Android Developer or an iOS developer?". So Slack is your only choice. 

- Everyone you know in your Slack group has knowledge on iOS, no one knows anything about Network Security. So your only choice is to ask the question on Stackoverflow.

## Should I learn on my own or join a BootCamp or get an associate degree? 
The path to success is anything between 6-24 months. There are no shortcuts. No Program is a silver bullet. 

The programs are meant to show you the path and help you stay on the path. Do not think by joining a university, bootcamp, the job is done. You're the one that has to spend time experimenting, finding yourself mentors, attending meetups, do the network, figuring out bugs, practicing, preparing for interviews, writing your resume, setting up sample projects, etc. 

For the right person and dedication, and with a good amount of luck and support, either of the approaches work.

## When is it beneficial to get a degree? 

- When you have no degrees at all. 
- When you want to go all in and you have time for it. 
Some of the top Machine Learning, AI experts at Apple, Google, Microsoft have done extensive research with truly experienced professors during their Masters or PhD programs enabling them to innovate in ways that others can't.
- You're attending an Ivy League university that has great professors. 
- The university has a great connection with the local companies and is great at helping you land your first job.

## I've gone through a bootcamp, done my own self-learning. How can I stand out? 
It's tough. A lot tougher than it was in 2020. Have something small but working that's already being used by more than 100 people. 

The two best examples I can think of are: 
- We had an engineer at work who at the time of joining was a relatively junior engineer, but he already had an app in the App Store. It didn't matter how many people were using his app. It just meant that he was a doer. His app was a simple but extremely functional [app for a Train Time Table](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patco-train-schedule/id1275141690). He identified a problem: It was difficult for commuters to to look into small font pdfs and try to find the time of the next train. He turned into a very easy to read app. 
- At a conference an engineer talked about an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nannerscanner/id1470699124) he owns. The app would just scan a banana and tell you if the banana was ripe or not. I asked him why did he do the app, he said:
    - There are some color blind people that can't tell. It was amazed. You can build apps that even yourself use. But still there's a market for it. 
    - I can speak about **my** own app experience during interviews.
    - I got to try out new Apple code for Machine Learning.
    - The app was super simple to build, it had only 2 - 3 screens. But I did it good. It made me stand out in a lot of conversations. 

## Summary
Find a mentor or join platforms and groups where you can quickly ask questions and get answers.
A four-year degree isnâ€™t always necessary, as most jobs focus on specific tasks. 
However, if you aim to be among the best, a degree can help. Whether you choose a bootcamp or self-study, having a mentor is key. Ultimately, success comes down to the effort and hard work you put in.
